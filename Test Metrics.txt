Test Metrics:
---------------
They are the parameters to measure your testing progress and product quality. 

It is also called standards of measuring the Testing process, product, project.

There are three types of Test metrics.

1.Process Metric:
----------------
The metric used to improve the process efficiency of the SDLC.

It can be used to improve the software development and maintenance.

Examples include Effectiveness Defect removal during development.

2.Product Metrics:
------------------

 It describes the quality of the software product. 

The size, Complexity, design features, Performance and quality level.

3.Project Metrics:
------------------
It describes the project characteristics and execution.

Example include the number of developers, cost, schedule and productivity.

Example Test Metrics:
======================
Defect Density:

Number of defects per size of software (e.g., per 1000 lines of code).

Test Case Execution Rate:

Percentage of executed test cases out of total planned.

Defect Removal Efficiency (DRE):

Ratio of defects found before release vs. total defects (including post-release).

Test Coverage:

Percentage of requirements or code covered by test cases.

Cycle Time :

Cycle Time = End Date – Start Date
